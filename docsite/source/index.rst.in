bitmath
#######

`bitmath <http://bitmath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ simplifies many
facets of interacting with file sizes in various units. Originally
focusing on file size unit conversion, functionality now includes:

* Converting between **SI** and **NIST** prefix units (``kB`` to ``GiB``)
* Converting between units of the same type (SI to SI, or NIST to NIST)
* Automatic human-readable prefix selection (like in `hurry.filesize <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hurry.filesize>`_)
* Basic arithmetic operations (subtracting 42KiB from 50GiB)
* Rich comparison operations (``1024 Bytes == 1KiB``)
* bitwise operations (``<<``, ``>>``, ``&``, ``|``, ``^``)
* Reading a device's storage capacity (Linux/OS X support only)
* String parsing
* Sorting
* `argparse <https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html>`_
  integration as a custom type

In addition to the conversion and math operations, `bitmath` provides
human readable representations of values which are suitable for use in
interactive shells as well as larger scripts and applications. The
format produced for these representations is customizable via the
functionality included in stdlibs `string.format
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html>`_.

In discussion we will refer to the NIST units primarily. I.e., instead
of "megabyte" we will refer to "mebibyte". The former is ``10^3 =
1,000,000`` bytes, whereas the second is ``2^20 = 1,048,576``
bytes. When you see file sizes or transfer rates in your web browser,
most of the time what you're really seeing are the base-2 sizes/rates.

**Don't Forget!** The source for bitmath `is available on GitHub
<https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath>`_.

And did we mention there's almost 200 unittests? `Check them out for
yourself <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/tree/master/tests>`_.

Installation
############

The easiest way to install bitmath is via ``dnf`` (or ``yum``) if
you're on a Fedora/RHEL based distribution. bitmath is available in
the main Fedora repositories, as well as EPEL Repositories. As of 2023
bitmath is only developed, tested, and supported for `currently
supported <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`_ Python releases.


.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo dnf install python3-bitmath


**PyPi**:

You could also install bitmath from `PyPi
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitmath>`_ if you like:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pip install bitmath

.. note::

   **pip** installs need pip >= 1.1. To workaround this, `download
   bitmath <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitmath/#downloads>`_, from
   PyPi and then ``pip install bitmath-x.y.z.tar.gz``. See `issue #57
   <https://github.com/tbielawa/bitmath/issues/57#issuecomment-227018168>`_
   for more information.



**Source**:

Or, if you want to install from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo python ./setup.py install

If you want the bitmath manpage installed as well:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo make install
